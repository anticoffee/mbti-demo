hello ðŸ‘‹

This is a sample link to my personal project MBTI aesthetic which is based on the popular app, Pinterest and MBTI's (a psychological theory about the different personalities).

Please understand this is not a final product and there are many things that need to be properly fixed, this was just a project to practice my html & css skills as I am just learning.

Unfortunately, I did face some difficulties trying to make this website functional on Github pages, where I would have liked for the user to click on the icons or navagation bar and be guided to a new html page. 
Therefore, I provided some pictures below to those html pages that were unable to be displayed.

Thank you!

Wanna try? --> https://anticoffee.github.io/mbti-demo/
